    "- **Data quality issues:**  \n",
    "  - Timestamps stored inconsistently (string and numeric formats).  \n",
    "  - Potential mismatches between session logs and player data.  \n",
    "  - Categorical imbalance (e.g., gender, experience levels).  \n",
    "  - Manual self-reporting bias for `experience`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unseen issues (possible):**  \n",
    "  - Sampling bias (active users only).  \n",
    "  - Time-zone inconsistencies in session logs.  \n",
    "  - Measurement inaccuracies for `played_hours` or inactive sessions not tracked.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data collection context:**  \n",
    "  Data likely originated from an online gaming analytics platform. Player profiles (`players.csv`) were recorded alongside gameplay logs (`sessions.csv`), collected automatically via backend telemetry systems that capture login times, play durations, and user characteristics.\n"

    "## (2) Question\n",
    "\n",
    "### Broad Question\n",
    "What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Question\n",
    "Can a player’s **age**, **gender**, **experience level**, and **total playtime** predict whether they **subscribe** to the game newsletter?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "- **Response variable:**  \n",
    "  - `subscribe` — whether the player subscribed to the newsletter (True/False)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanatory variables:**  \n",
    "  - `Age` — player’s age in years  \n",
    "  - `gender` — categorical variable describing player gender  \n",
    "  - `experience` — player’s self-reported skill level (categorical)  \n",
    "  - `played_hours` — total hours spent playing  \n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Data Will Be Used\n",
    "This project will use data from `players.csv`, which contains all demographic and experience-related variables.  \n",
    "To better capture behavioural aspects, I will also use `sessions.csv` to compute additional summaries for each player:\n",
    "- total number of sessions recorded  \n",
    "- average session duration (from start and end times)\n",
    "\n",
    "These values will then be joined to the `players` data using the `hashedEmail` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Wrangling Plan\n",
    "1. **Join datasets:** Combine `players.csv` and `sessions.csv` by `hashedEmail`.  \n",
    "2. **Clean data:** Remove missing or invalid values (e.g., missing ages or incomplete session times).  \n",
    "3. **Feature creation:** Create a variable for average session duration per player.  \n",
    "4. **Convert data types:** Ensure `subscribe` is a logical (TRUE/FALSE) variable and categorical predictors use `factor()`.  \n",
    "5. **Tidy data:** Keep one row per player, ready for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Question Fits the Data and Methods\n",
    "- The response variable (`subscribe`) is a yes or no, which makes it suitable for a **linear regression model**. \n",
    "- The explanatory variables include both numeric and categorical data, which allows for simple comparisons and visualization using bar graphs and scatterplots\n",
    "- The relationship between player behaviour (e.g., `played_hours`) and subscription status can be explored visually before modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Insights\n",
    "Exploring this question will help identify which types of players are more likely to subscribe to the newsletter.  \n",
    "This can provide useful information about player engagement and help guide marketing or community outreach efforts for the game.\n"
